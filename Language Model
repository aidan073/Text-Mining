Task: 
Create a language model that can predict what genre a song is based on its lyrics.

Plan/Considerations: 

Structure:
  *Tokenize lyrics by words (get each word in the lyrics as a different token)

  Training method:
    Arguments - 
    (Text from a song in the training data, genre of that song)
    
    Purpose - 
    Uses the training data to associate words with a genre.

    Execution -
    Given a Jazz song (for this example), read its lyrics in. Have a variable for total words in the lyrics.
    Calculate how many times each word appears in the lyrics (term frequency).
    Iteration could look something like:

    totalWords = 0
    # Calculate term frequency (how many times does the word appear in this song)
    for word in lyrics:
        tf_dict_jazz[word] += 1
        totalWords += 1
    
    # Calculate document frequency (how many songs does the word appear in *out of all songs, not just jazz songs)
    for word in set(lyrics):
        df_dict[word] += 1

  algorithm to calculate tfidf (tf * idf) of a word -> (tf_dict_jazz[word]/totalWords)*log(docNum/df)       explanation: (number of times the term appears in the document/total number of terms in the document) * log(total number of documents/number of documents containing the word)
  
  Now add each tfidf to another dictionary.
