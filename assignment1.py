#assumption for first website: there are some quotes by Michael that contain comments from the narrator. I am assuming that this is too infrequent to make a difference, because distinguishing between the narrator and michael would be difficult.
#assumption for second website: any time a capital letter followed by a colon [A-Z]:, or 3 capital letters [A-Z]{3,} appear, it is considered to be someone other than Michael talking.
